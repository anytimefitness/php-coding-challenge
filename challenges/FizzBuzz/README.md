#### Given the scenario outlined below, build out how you would solve the challenge.

##### Scenario: Adjusted FizzBuzz

For the numbers 1 to 100:
  * If the number is divisible by 3 echo the word "Fizz" in red
  * If the number is divisible by 5 echo the word "Buzz" in blue, 
  * If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, echo the word "Fizz" in red, and "Buzz" in blue
  * If the number is not divisible by 3 nor 5, echo the number in black.


Should end up looking something like (note we didnt do the styling of the divs properly):

```html
12<span red>Fizz</div>4<span blue>Buzz</div><span red>Fizz</div>78<span red>Fizz</div><span blue>Buzz</div>
```
