#### Given the scenario outlined below, build out how you would solve the challenge.

##### Scenario: Library

Finish the following classes:

 * [Library](./Library.php)
 * [Book](./Book.php)
    
The goal is to create a library, with books, that satisfy the constraints provided in
the doc block comments.

If you are comfortable running tests, you can run `composer install` in the base directory of
this repo to install php unit, and then run:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

If everything passes, you know you've done it right!
